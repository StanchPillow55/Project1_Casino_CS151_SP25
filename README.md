Our casino consists of a handful of the classics: Roulette, Slots, BlackJack, Poker (5-hand) and of course, Sports Betting. All of our cards based games have 6 different decks to choose from, leading to unpredictable hands but also much lower efficiency of card counting. All games are singleplayer, you versus the house. You start with $1000 and will get kicked out (error handling and UI done by Bradley) if you (1) win $1,000,000 total, (2) Drink more than 5 drinks or (3) Type EXIT at anytime.

They are usable as follows:
Roulette (Vince) - Upon choosing the roulette option, one is prompted with how much money they want to bet. If you exceed the amount you currently have (you can use dollars or chips), you will be prompted to try again. Once in the game, you can choose to split up your initial bet among the 36 different numbers. Once you have chosen your bets, you will win 2x your money back on whatever number wins that you bet on and lose money on whichever ones do not win. There is no functionality for betting on colors. 

Slots (Justin) - You can put up an initial bet and win a different multiple of money based on whatever winning combination you get (if any at all). All the winning combinations are equally likely, you only have to start up the slots, place an initial bet and you will be betting all of that on one roll.

BlackJack (Bradley) - Choose blackjack and post a bet (there is not functionality for doubling down) you will be dealt two cards and will be able to see one of the dealers. Continaul checks ensure that we will know if you have won or lost and that the dealer has not already won as you continue to try to reach 21. Aces have conditional logic to give you the best possible hand, being a 1 or 11 depending on whatever will get you to 21 or make you not exceed it. 

Poker (Bradley) - You will be dealt 5 cards and will have to post an initial bet to even be dealt the cards. Upon seeing your cards, you may increase your bet or stay the same. After betting, both of you will reveal your cards, your cards will be ranked and compared, and if you win, you get a 2x payout.

Sport Betting (Govil) - Odds are predetermined and according to the likelihood of the team winning, you will get a payout if it occurs (for example, if a team is more likely to lose and they win, you get a higher payout)

Navigation is done through our UI (Bradley) which reads numbers to initialize an appropriate object and you also play through this very same UI which will prompt you for bets and output important information such as your cards and winnning numbers / combos.

Do not get too drunk, enjoy our games and try to win as much as you can (but not too much) !

Class Structure and Design Choices:
We have a separate UI class that serves as our "main". Besides that we have game objects for initializing games with things such as an initialBet, to say "this is how much money you are bringing to a table" whilst it is not necessarily all of your money. In this way, we represent "forced" self-restraint as one says "I will only lose at MOST this much" at any given game (or table), versus what someone bets per round may be different. Notice that the games are not actually iterable in this way, as we were struggling with making a new object (to count towards the 100 instances) whilst carrying over the prior conditions as in to emulate something such as "card-counting". We also did not know how this would be incorporated in sports-betting, as usually one only gets to bet on all the games at one time, and that would mean randomizing games and times repeatedly, whilst excluding ones already seen to a user (most teams dont play twice in the same day), so we scrapped the idea altogether, and went with a much simpler approach of just making a new game everytime. We then have subclasses of those objects that actual run the games, as in one class handles setup, the other, run-time. In practice, this was an oversight on how much setup was really (in terms of variables and initializing the games conditions such as decks of cards, sports teams or winning combinations) needed and it all could have fit into one class. On another note, we use a bank class to consistently check if one has enough funds to place a bet, and to handle all exchanges of chips and money. When you are at a casino, you most likely will be thinking of your chips as money (hence betting was set up using money) but you actually bet the money using chips (which we do for the user), hence the gambling money is handled in chips but the prompting is done in dollars (money). Additionally, we allow one to cash out. In reality, this can be done to different degrees where one can have more money and get more chips or only cash out some of their chips and continue to gamble. To make our lives easier, we decided that most people turn a good amount of money ($1000) into chips, and then if they win a good amount, they cash it out all at once and call it a day. Finally, in a casino, people are cyclically inebriated to make their decision making worse and hopefully make it so they lose more money. We are not going to slur the words and make reading more difficult as one continues to play (as randomizing all the output strings is not only costly but makes testing difficult, however scalability is possible with increased randomness), however, when one becomes a public nuisance or threat under heavy alochol intake, they get removed from the premises. In practice, people get less drunk over time, however, our games have no time variable and if they did, it would have been rounds but we scrapped that idea for prior listed reasons, resulting in the structure you see today.

TLDR: Initial planning leading to oversight in implementation and a lack of time in final cleanup resulted in major simplification of the final project with noticeable inconsistencies, errors and minimalistic design.
